# S8

## My Team Members

Dr Mounika, 
Meenakshi and 
Vivek

we separated the ResNet code files and saved in google drive as resnetmodel, and uploaded them in github 

we changed the code to increase the accuracy by adding softmax

We changed the code to replace FC layer to point wise convolution layer
[https://github.com/DrVenkataRajeshKumar/S8/blob/master/rn.py]

we got 85% accuracy at 8th EPOCH and 90% accuracy at 13th EPOCH

## My Team Members

Dr Mounika, 
Meenakshi and 
Vivek

we separated the ResNet code files and saved in goole drive as resnetmodel, and uploaded them in github [https://github.com/DrVenkataRajeshKumar/S8/blob/master/resnetmodel.py] 

we changed the code to increase the accuracy by adding softmax

We changed the code to replace FC layer to point wise convolution layer

we got 85% accuracy at 8th EPOCH and 90% accuracy at 13th EPOCH
